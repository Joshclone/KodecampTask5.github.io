            train
            and
            bring people up skill wise, knowledge wise to the very least my level. I started up an ICT mini group and I
            spent
            quality time teaching my students the ins and out of frontend development my initial reasons at first was to
            get
            better but along the line I loved every bit of it, yes it did improve my proficiency level knowledge wise
            but

            large.
